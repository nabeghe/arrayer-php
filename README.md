$data1 = ['key_1' => 'value_1', 'key_3' => ['key_3_1' => 'value_3_1']];

$data2 = ['key_2' => 'value_2'];

$data3 = ['key_3' => ['key_3_2' => 'value_3_2']];

$arrayer = new Arrayer();

print_r($arrayer->merge($data1, $data2, $data3)->data);

/*
    Array
    (
        [key_1] => value_1
        [key_3] => Array
            (
                [key_3_1] => value_3_1
                [key_3_2] => value_3_2
            )
    
        [key_2] => value_2
    )
 */
```

### Arrayer Class

Accepts any value, converts it to an array via `Arr::cast`, stores it, and returns it via `data` property.

It is possible to access the methods of the `Arr` class through the `Arrayer` object as well, with the difference that the main array parameter is no longer present.

Additionally, the `ArrayAccess` and `JsonSerializable` interfaces have also been implemented on `Arrayer` class.
